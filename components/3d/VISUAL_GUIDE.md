## 💫 Animation Behaviors

### Particle Field
1. **On Load:** Particles spawn and begin gentle rotation
2. **Idle:** Continuous slow rotation + wave motion
3. **Mouse Move:** Particles within 3 units gently move away
4. **Scroll:** Animation continues (background stays fixed)

### Floating Shapes
1. **On Load:** Shapes spawn at positions with float effect
2. **Idle:** Gentle floating up/down + rotation
3. **Mouse Move:** No interaction (purely decorative)
4. **Scroll:** Animation continues smoothly

### Wave Background
1. **On Load:** Wave animation starts immediately
2. **Idle:** Multi-layered waves continuously flow
3. **Mouse Move:** No interaction
4. **Scroll:** Background moves with perspective

### Interactive 3D Card
1. **On Load:** Card renders in neutral position
2. **Idle:** Static, no animation
3. **Mouse Enter:** Glow effect fades in
4. **Mouse Move:** Card tilts following cursor
5. **Mouse Leave:** Smoothly returns to neutral + glow fades

## 🎯 When to Use Each

### Use Particle Field when:
✅ You want an interactive background
✅ Your portfolio is tech/developer focused
✅ You want modern, dynamic feel
✅ User engagement is important

### Use Floating Shapes when:
✅ You want abstract/artistic look
✅ Your portfolio showcases creative work
✅ You prefer passive animations
✅ You want unique visual identity

### Use Wave Background when:
✅ You want minimal distraction
✅ Your content is the main focus
✅ You need best performance
✅ You prefer elegant simplicity

### Use 3D Cards when:
✅ You want interactive project cards
✅ You need subtle hover effects
✅ You want to highlight specific content
✅ You combine with other animations

## 🔄 Mixing Animations

You can combine multiple animations:

### Good Combinations ✅
- Wave Background + 3D Cards
- Particle Field + 3D Cards
- Wave Background + Floating Shapes (subtle)

### Avoid ❌
- Particle Field + Floating Shapes (too busy)
- All three backgrounds together (overwhelming)
- Multiple interactive backgrounds
